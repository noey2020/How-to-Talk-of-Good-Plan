So you've done your homework and all those esoteric analysis in Matlab, Python, and
Excel. You have those awesome graphs and charts from data in csv. You've cleaned,
prepped, and done exploratory analysis.

You are ready to trade. Previewed your order, submitted it and watching closely.
You're just a retail investor watching from your computer screen. Your only source
of trading activity is yourself.

I glance on many other sources and one of them is:

https://robinhood.com/us/en/
https://www.myfxbook.com/

When you made an order. The broker, in real-time, can create a trendline from all the
posting of orders. The broker can see trading activity and can update all positions as
to when to sell or buy. 

When is a noticeable tumble, you start shorting. Ane when shorting, you can sell at
different price points. Glancing on many other sources is like sentiment analysis.
Glancing enables you to track, compare, analyze and share your trading activity.

Normally, you would "Limit Order" as opposed to "Market Order".

Some call it "betting on the crowd". 

This is a good plan and not a perfect plan.

Drunk trading. drink 2 shots and trade, hehehe.

Past winners maybe today's losers.

I included some posts for reference.
